#### Standard extensions

The FHIR specification contains a lot of pre-defined standard extensions created for frequently occuring scenarios. Implementers lacking ways to express certain bits of information should first of all explore those extensions before creating their own custom extensions.

The official extensions created by HL7 for HL7 FHIR R4 can be found at the [FHIR Core-defined Extension Registry](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/extensibility-registry.html)
