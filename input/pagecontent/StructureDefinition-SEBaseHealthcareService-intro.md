### Use of organization.type
There are multiple code systems describing organization types in Sweden. <br />
- The National Board of Health and Welfare are maintaining a code system called "Verksamhetsomr√•den" that is used for reporting quality data to national quality registries: [Verksamhetskoder](https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/globalassets/sharepoint-dokument/dokument-webb/klassifikationer-och-koder/sjukhuskoder-kodlista-verksamhetsomraden-2006.pdf) <br />
- The Health and Social Care Inspectorate (IVO) also have a code system describing health care organizations that is used when reporting irregularities or register complaints. <br />
- The only code system that has been found with a clear namespace that can be identified and that is widely used in an interoperablilty context is the [HSA Verksamhetskoder](https://inera.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OIKH/pages/346560593/HSA+kodverk). Therefore the only code system used in the organization base profile is the HSA Verksamhetskoder. If necessary, other code systems can be used when suitable.
